# Introduction
## Data Types

- Number - Any number, (including number with decimals)
- String - Group of characters (enclosed in single/double quotes (doesn't matter at all))
- Boolean - `true` / `false`
- Null - `null` (Intentional absence of a value)
- Undefined - `undefined` (a non defined entity; different than null)
- Symbol - A newer feature to the language (no need to give stress on this one for now)
- Object - Collection of a related data

> The first 6 are more of a primitive data types. Objects are different

## Arithmetic Operators
- + 
- -
- * (multiply)
- /
- % (remainder; known as the modulo)

## String Concatenation
Nothing just adding strings

- Use `,` to add space between to lines `console.log('Hello','World')`


> Following sections are about properties and methods and built-in objects. Like any other OOP; properties and methods are as same as attributes (variables defined inside a class) and methods (functions defined inside a class) in javascript. 
## Properties
This is rather something to pick up on. Every object in javascript has a certain properties. (It's more like attributes in css. Like `<p>` and `<div>` tag had their attributes.)
- Every _String_ instance has a property called `length`, which can be used as `console.log('Hello'.length);`
- The `.` is another _operator_ (aka the _dot operator_)

> Fun fact: Javascript can be played without semicolons. But use them still. Don't wanna use? Good luck debugging your 1000 lines of javascript code.

## Methods
Methods are actions that we can perform.
- Methods are nothing but functions made for object (YES! ThE OOPs)

> console.log(); // YESS!! Here .log() is a method. of console class
> TODO: Practice with `console` class in your free time. Seems cute to me.

### Methods for string datatypes
- `.toUpperCase()`: Uppify the string
- `startsWith(searchString)`: Checks if the string starts with the given string
- `trim()`: Trim the whitespaces at the beginning and the end of a string.

> In the javascript docs, if there is a function's syntax like
> `''.startsWith( searchString [, length])` it means it has a must needed argument (that's outside the \[\]) and _can take an extra_ argument (more like as a feature) inside the \[\]. Here, \[length\] is an _extra_ argument.

## Built-in objects
Objects are nothing but instances of classes in javascript. Some common objects we use include `Math` from class of math.

> `Math.random()` returns a value between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive).

# Variables
Here, we will work with `var`, `let`, `const`.

- There's a difference between `var` and `let` but will cover when it comes to _functions and block codes in javascript (whatever the shit is)_
- `var` and `let` if left unassigned (`var myVar; let myVar2`) their value is automatically set to `undefined` [[javascript 101#Data Types]]
- With `var` and `let` we can reassign variables, unlike `const`.
- You need to assign a value to the variable when using `const` (Can't leave it undefined).

## Mathematical Assignment Operators
- We have `+=` as an assignment operator
```javascript
let w = 4
let w = w + 1 // makes w = 5

let w = 10
let w += 1 // makes w = 11; FEATURE OP
```
- Similarly `-= *= /=` also exists

## Increment and Decrement Operator
- Yeps they exist; both ways
	- `++a //increments and then puts the value; a++ //puts the value and then increment`
	- `--a // decrements and then puts the value; a-- //puts the value and then decrements`

## String concatenation with variables
pff, move on.

## String Interpolation
Side stuff: Remember anything about `eval` and how "\`"(backticks) were used to interpret things inside it. Well here it comes. _YOU CAN CREATE __TEMPLATE STRINGS__ USING BACKTICKS.

```javascript
const myPet = 'armadillo';  
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`); // Notice the backticks are used as in to evaluate the string before logging it to the console.
```

## typeof
This operator is used to check the data type of a variable.
```javascript
let unknown1 = 'hello world'
let unknown2 = 2
typeof unknown1 // string
typeof unknown2 // number
```

> ProTip: You can use `typeof` as an _operator_ as well as a function.
> `typeof operand`
> `typeof(operand)` 
> Think of places where you cannot use space.


## Extra Remarks 
- Adding (+) a `boolean` to a `number` value adds one `1` to the `number`. However if you use `,` (comma) it separates the 2 value with a space.

# The Javascript Frameworks
- 2009 - **Node.js** was launched to allow for javascript code execution outside the browser
- 2010 - **Angular.js** framework was released and grew in popularity with its object oriented and reactive programming.
- 2013 - **React.js** library was released with functional programming model.
	- On a little sidenote - **Electron.js** was also released in this year to develop desktop apps with front / back-end web languages
- 2014 - **Vue.js** framework was released and grew popularity due to its reactive programming model.

# Conditionals

## if statements
```javascript
if (true) {  
 console.log('This message will print!');  
}
```

## if-else statements
```javascript
if (false) {  
 console.log('The code in this block will not run.');  
} else {  
 console.log('But the code in this block will!');  
}
```

## Comparison operators
- < - less than
- > - greater than
- <= - less than or equal to
- >= - greater than or equal to
- === - is strictly equal to
- !== - is not equal to

> For once `1 == true` would return true but not `1 === true`. This is because of the strict comparison. 
> Source: https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/whats-the-different-between-two-and-three-equal-signs/505767

## Logical Operators
- && - and
- || - or
- ! - not

## Truthy and Falsy

The following conditions evaluate to be false:
- (Datatype: Number) 0
- Empty Strings like "" or ''
- `null` which represent when there is no value at all
- `undefined` represent when a declared variable lacks a value
- `NaN` or Not a Number

__REST ALL EVALUATES TO TRUE__

> In a boolean condition, JavaScript assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the `||` operator in your assignment:
```javascript
let username = '';  
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';
console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger
```

## Ternary operator

```javascript
// (condition) ? true-statement : false-statement
isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');
```

## Elseif statement

```javascript
if (season === 'spring') {
 console.log('It\'s spring! The trees are budding!');
} else if (season === 'winter') {
 console.log('It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.')
} else {
 console.log('Invalid season.');
}
```

## The switch keyword

```javascript
let athleteFinalPosition = 'first place';

switch (athleteFinalPosition){
 case 'first place':
	 console.log('You get the gold medal!')
	 break
 case 'second place':
	 console.log('You get the silver medal!')
	 break
 case 'third place':
	 console.log('You get the bronze medal!')
	 break
 default:
	 console.log('No medal awarded.')
	 break
}
```

# Functions

In javascript there are many ways to declare a function. One possible way is by this:

```javascript
function greetWorld(){
	console.log('Hello World!');
}
```

> Be aware of the _hoisting_ feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before theyâ€™re defined. FUCK YEAA.

```javascript
greetWorld();

function greetWorld(){
	console.log('Hello World!');
}
```

## Parameters and Arguments

> There's a difference between parameters and arguments.
>
> **Parameter**: Parameter are _variables_ passed into a function; (it is usually when _Defining a function_)
> **Arguments**: The _values_ that are passed into a function when it is called; `greetWorld("Hello","World")`

## Default Parameters
> Default parameters allow parameters to have a predetermined value in case there is no argument passed into the function or if the argument is `undefined` when called.

> ```javascript
> function greeting (name = 'stranger') {  
>  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)  
> }  
>   
> greeting('Nick') // Output: Hello, Nick!  
> greeting() // Output: Hello, stranger!
> ```

> If in case you want to give value to 1, 3 but want to keep the 2nd variable _default_. You can use `undefined` for the 2nd variable
```javascript
function makeShoppingList(item1='milk', item2='bread', item3='eggs'){
 console.log(`Remember to buy ${item1}`);
 console.log(`Remember to buy ${item2}`);
 console.log(`Remember to buy ${item3}`);
}
makeShoppingList('almonds',undefined,'chicken')
```

## Return

```javascript

const numOfMonitors = monitorCount(5,4)

function monitorCount(rows, columns){
 return rows*columns
}
console.log(numOfMonitors)
```

### Helper Functions

We can use the return value of 1 function in the return value of another.

```javascript
function multiplyByNineFifths(number) {  
	return number * (9/5);
};

function getFahrenheit(celsius) {  
	return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
}; 

getFahrenheit(15); // Returns 59
```

## Function Expressions

Oooh! Here comes the second way of defining functions.

```JAVASCRIPT
const functionName = function(parameter1, parameter2) { // function is the actual keyword to be used.
	// lines of a function
	return // not necessary
}

// To call this function you call it by it's variable name.

functionName(argument1,argument2)

```

> NOTE THAT FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS ARE NOT HOISTED. SO YOU CANNOT CALL THE `functionName` BEFORE IT'S DEFINITION.

## Arrow Functions

HOO HOO HOO!! The third type.
Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword `function` every time you need to create a function. (Even better lol)

```javascript
const functionName = (parameter1, parameter2) => {  
	// code here  
	return // not necessary
};
```

### Concise Body Arrow Functions

Ooohhooo. This just keeps getting better.
 
> The most condensed form of the function is known as _concise body_. (In short, the shorter the function the better.)

- Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.
```javascript
// Zero Parameters
const functionName = () => {};

// One Parameters
const functionName = parameter1 => {};

// Two or more parameters
const functionName = (parameter1,parameter2) => {};
```

- _A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces_. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow `=>` and the `return` keyword can be removed. This is referred to as __implicit return__.

```javascript
// One parameter and one line of code inside the function
const sumNumbers = number => number + number;
```

> Note the `return` keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block 

# Scope
Defining the scope of a variable and other stuff
## Blocks and Scope

A block is set of instructions defined in `{}`. A function has a block, an if statement has a block.

> It is preferable to have one variable outside of a block and the other inside of a block, because it will then be global and thus can be accessed by any piece of code.

## Global Scope
In _global scope_, variables are declared outside of blocks. Thus are termed as _global variables_

## Block Scope
This is where the defined variables are known as _local variables_

## Scope Pollution
It seems like if you change the value of a global variable in any _block_ it changes it's value globally. 

```javascript
let num = 50;  
  
const logNum = () => {  
 num = 100; // Take note of this line of code  
 console.log(num);  
};  
  
logNum(); // Prints 100  
console.log(num); // Prints 100
```
This is also known as _scope pollution_.
- The solution to this problem is use `let num = 100` in the _block code_. 
	- That way a new variable called `num` will be assigned in the block. Even tho `num` is already assigned to a value in global namespace, we will have a second instance of `num` in the local namespace.

> Note that re-assignment of a (new for the local block) variable is not throwing error. __MAKE SURE TO NOTE THAT CHANGING OF GLOBAL VARIABLES IS PERMITTED IN THE LOCAL BLOCK.__

## Practice Good scoping
Again to prevent scope pollution use `let` to define variables inside a local scope by practice.

# Arrays

The classic way of defining arrays:

```javascript
let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
```

> An array can hold different data types.

## Accessing Elements

*There was an image here*

> You can also access individual characters in a string.
> 
> ```javascript
> const mystring = 'hello world'
> console.log(mystring[6]) // will print out 'w'
> ```

- If you try to access an index that is beyond the last element then it states `undefined`.

## Updating Elements

```javascript
let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];  
  
seasons[3] = 'Autumn';  
console.log(seasons);  
//Output: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']
```

## Arrays with let and const

Note that arrays defined with let can be changed and re-assigned. But the arrays defined with `const` can be changed BUT CAN'T BE RE-ASSIGNED.
- Meaning:

```javascript
const cars = ['toyota','bmw','ferrari']
cars[2] = 'maruti' // Executes correctly

cars = ['maruti'] // throws an error because const arrays cannot be re-defined.
```

## The .length property

`console.log(myarray.length) // prints length of myarray`

## The .push() method
This method is used to add items at the end of an array.

```javascript
const itemlist = ['','','']

itemlist.push('','') // yes this can take single or multiple arguments.
```

> You might also see `.push()` referred to as a _destructive_ array method since it changes the initial array.

## The .pop() method

Removes the last item from the array. 
- After popping the element from the array _it saves the array with the same name_ and returns the popped item
```javascript
const newItemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2']; 
const removed = newItemTracker.pop(); 
console.log(newItemTracker); // Output: [ 'item 0', 'item 1' ]console.log(removed);// Output: item 2
```

## More array methods

Some arrays methods that are available to JavaScript developers include: `.join()`, `.slice()`, `.splice()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, and `.concat()` amongst many others.

- shift() - removes the element in the begginning of an array
- unshift( arg) - adds the item or 2 (can take multiple) at the beginning of an array. It needs an argument. `arrat.unshift('hello','world',69)`
- slice(arg1, \[arg2\]) - returns a part of an array in a new array object. `array.slice(2)// will display all the elements from 3rd element onwards(including 3rd); array.slice(2,4) // will display all the elements from 3rd element on and before the 5th element (not including 5)`
- .splice(index, \[remove any element? specify how many\], \[arg3\], \[arg4\]): edit an array. This is little complex to understand.
	- *index* makes it place the pointer at the index. 
	- *remove any element* part specifies whether you want to remove any element from the array if any number is given it removes that many elements. This is optional.
	- then following *arg3, arg4* are the elements that has to be newly added to the array ON THAT PARTICULAR *index*.
- indexOf(arg, \[numOfOccurence\]) - Returns the first index at which the given argument can be found (if not found -1 is returned). Say if you want to find the index of 2,3,4th occurence and so on occurence. `array.indexOf('pasta',3)` will give out the index of 3rd occurence of 'pasta' string in the array.

## Nested Arrays
Uk the drill... Go on. To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation.

# Loops

## The For loop

```javascript
for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {  
 console.log(counter);  
}
```

## Looping Through Arrays
```javascript
const vacationSpots = ['Bali', 'Paris', 'Tulum'];

for (let i = 0 ; i < vacationSpots.length; i++){
 console.log(`I would love to visit ${vacationSpots[i]}`);
}
```

## while loop

```javascript
let counterTwo = 1;  
while (counterTwo < 4) {  
 console.log(counterTwo);  
 counterTwo++;
}
```

## do-while statements

Hellow, brother! Long time no see huh!
```javascript
let countString = '';
let i = 0; 
do {  
countString = countString + i;  
i++;
} while (i < 5); 
console.log(countString);
```

## The break keyword
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 99; i++) {  
 if (i > 2 ) {  
 break;  
 }  
 console.log('Banana.');  
}
```

# Higher Order Functions
A _higher-order function_ is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both!

Abstraction: Long-story-short assign meaningful names to function, so that code readability++

## Function as Data
In javascript you can re-assign a function as variables and use that variable to reference to that particular function.
```javascript
var announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork = () => console.log('I\'m doing some important shit').
const busy = announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork; 
busy(); // This function call barely takes any space!
```

> In JavaScript, functions are _first class objects_. This means that, like other objects youâ€™ve encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods. (props like .length / .name; methods like toString())

## Function as parameters
- We call the functions that get passed in as parameters and invoked _callback functions_ because they get called during the execution of the higher-order function.

```javascript
const timeFuncRuntime = funcParameter => {  
 let t1 = Date.now();  
 funcParameter();  
 let t2 = Date.now();  
 return t2 - t1;  
}  
  
const addOneToOne = () => 1 + 1;  
  
timeFuncRuntime(addOneToOne);
```

- We invoked `timeFuncRuntime()` first with the `addOneToOne()` function as parameter - note how we passed in `addOneToOne` and did not invoke it.

> When we pass a function in as an argument to another function, we donâ€™t invoke it. Invoking the function would evaluate to the return value of that function call. SO JUST CALL THE FUNCTION NAME WITHOUT THE PARANTHESIS.

## Anonymous Functions as arguments

```javascript
timeFuncRuntime(() => {  
	for (let i = 10; i>0; i--){
		console.log(i);  
}
});
```

Here you can see an _anonymous function_ passed as an argument. YESSS ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS CAN BE ARGUMENTS TOO... This just makes javascript too complicated... But smart. No wonder how javascript obfuscation is a thing.

# Iterators
## forEach() function

- `.forEach()` function loops through the given array.
- It takes in a *callback function* (A function that is being passed as an argument to another function).
- `forEach()` loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element.
```javascript
groceries = ['brown sugar','salt','craneberries','walnuts']

groceries.forEach(function(a){console.log(' - '+ a);});
```

- You can also use the ARRAY FUNCTIONS within .forEach()

```javascript
groceries.forEach(groceryItem => console.log(groceryItem));
```

- We can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.

```javascript
function printGrocery(element){
	console.log(element);
} 

groceries.forEach(printGrocery);
```

## .map() function

- This function is called on an array (with a callback function as an argument) and returns a new array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  
const bigNumbers = numbers.map(number => {  return number * 10;});
```

> The only difference between .map() and .forEach() is .map() returns a new array.

## .filter() function

- Like `.map()` function `.filter()` also returns an array. However it filters out certain elements out of it.
	- To put the element to the new array the callback function has to `return true`

```javascript
const words = ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door'];  
const shortWords = words.filter(word => {  return word.length < 6;})
```

## .findIndex() function
- This function returns the index of the first element that `return true`.
	- It returns a `number` value in the variable.
	- Note that the loop in the callback function is checking through the element and returned value into the variable is the index of that element that evaluates to true.

```javascript
const jumbledNums = [123, 25, 78, 5, 9];  
const lessThanTen = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {  return num < 10;});
```

- If the element is not present in the index it return `-1`

## .reduce() function
